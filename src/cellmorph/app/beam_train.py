"""
Fully trains a neural cellular automata model using Beam.Cloud tasks to provide
GPU acceleration.

Command-line arguments:
    - "-c"/"--config-file": The path to a configuration file containing all
      necessary values and parameters to both create a model and train it.  This
      path may be either absolute or relative; however, it must obviously exist
      in order for the program to continue.
    - "-e"/"--epochs": Specifies a custom number of training epochs that
      overrides that in the configuration file.
    - "-l"/"--logging-level": The global logging level that determines which
      logging messages appear in the model-specific log file.  Any option other
      than "off" will filter messages such that if a message's level is beneath
      the global level then it will be ignored.  Please note that using "off" to
      disable logging will result in silencing *all* logging output, including
      any exceptions that are thrown in functions decorated with
      `@logger.catch` with the sole exception of `main`.
    - "-n"/"--name": Specifies a custom model name that overrides that in the
      configuration file.
    - "-t"/"--target": Specifies a custom training target that overrides that in
      the configuration file.

           training.  As such, every model is compiled without exception.
        2. `quiet` - Because a Beam.Cloud task is non-interactive, there is no
           purpose in displaying textual output besides any error(s).  If
           progress-specific information is required, setting the logging level
